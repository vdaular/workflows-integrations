## 🧠 Overview

This package extends [Elsa Workflows](https://github.com/elsa-workflows/elsa-core) with support for **Sql**. It introduces custom activities that make it easy to integrate Sql features directly into your workflow logic.

## ✨ Key Features

- Activities: `SqlQuery`, `SqlCommand` and `SqlSingleValue`
- Automatic sql parameterization of Variables, Inputs, Outputs and other keywords to help Sql injection.
- Add-in approach to each database provider, with the ability to easily integrate other providers using the `ISqlClient` interface.
- Syntax highlighting for SQL

---

## ⚡ Getting Started

### 📋 Prerequisites

- Elsa Workflows **V3** installed in your project.
- Access to the database (credentials, server address, etc...).

## 🛠 Installation

The following NuGet packages are available for this integration:

```bash
Elsa.Integration.Sql
Elsa.Integration.Sql.MySql
Elsa.Integration.Sql.PostgreSql
Elsa.Integration.Sql.Sqlite
Elsa.Integration.Sql.SqlServer
```

You can install the clients via NuGet:

```bash
dotnet add package Elsa.Integration.Sql.<Client>
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Program.cs

Register the integration in your `Program.cs` startup:

```csharp
using Elsa.Extensions;
using Elsa.Sql.Extensions;
using Elsa.Sql.MySql;
using Elsa.Sql.PostgreSql;
using Elsa.Sql.Sqlite;
using Elsa.Sql.SqlServer;

services.AddElsa(elsa =>
    {
        elsa.UseSql(options =>
            {
                options.Clients = client =>
                {
                    client.Register<MySqlClient>("MySql");
                    client.Register<PostgreSqlClient>("PostgreSql");
                    client.Register<SqliteClient>("Sqlite");
                    client.Register<SqlServerClient>("Sql Server");
                };
            })
    }
```

Note: Names within the `("")` are optional.
These are used for retrieving the client implementation and for displaying a user friendly name in Elsa Studio.
If no name is provided, the client class name will be given as the default value, i.e. `SqliteClient`.

### Appsettings.json
There are no configuration options that can be set in `appsettings.json` for this integration.

## 📌 Usage

Once the implementation is registered with your required clients, the activities will be ready to use, either via code or [Elsa Studio](https://github.com/elsa-workflows/elsa-studio).

## 🚀 Activities 

This integration comes with the following activities:

### SqlQuery

| Properties | Type | Description | Input/Output | Notes |
| ---------- | ---- | ----------- | --- | ----- |
| Client | string? | The client to use, populated from registered clients in `Program.cs`. | Input | - |
| ConnectionString | string? / Secret | Database connection string. Can also be from a secret. | Input | - |
| Query | string? | Query string. Expressions can also be used with `{{ }}`. | Input | - |
| Results | DataSet? | Results from executing the query. | Output | Can not be serialized. |

### SqlCommand

| Properties | Type | Description | Input/Output | Notes |
| ---------- | ---- | ----------- | --- | ----- |
| Client | string? | The client to use, populated from registered clients in `Program.cs`. | Input | - |
| ConnectionString | string? / Secret | Database connection string. Can also be from a secret. | Input | - |
| Command | string? | Command string. Expressions can also be used with `{{ }}`. | Input | - |
| Result | int? | The number of rows affected. | Output | - |

### SqlSingleValue 

| Properties | Type | Description | Input/Output | Notes |
| ---------- | ---- | ----------- | --- | ----- |
| Client | string? | The client to use, populated from registered clients in `Program.cs`. | Input | - |
| ConnectionString | string? / Secret | Database connection string. Can also be from a secret. | Input | - |
| Query | string? | Query string. Expressions can also be used with `{{ }}`. | Input | - |
| Result | object? | Result from executing the command. | Output | - |



## 🧪 Examples

### Expressions

Expressions can be used to dynamically populate the query with workflow properties.
The `SqlEvaluator` will then use the properties set in the `ISqlClient` to parameterize the query for that clients implementation.
For example, a SQL Server query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM [Users] WHERE [Name] = {{Variable.Name}} AND [Age] > {{Input.Age}};
```

Will be converted into:

```sql
SELECT * FROM [Users] WHERE [Name] = @p1 AND [Age] > @p2;
```


### Supported Expressions

```csharp
{{Workflow.Definition.Id}}
{{Workflow.Definition.Version}}
{{Workflow.Instance.Id}} 
{{Correlation.Id}}
{{LastResult}} 
{{Input.<InputName>}}
{{Output.<OutputName>}}
{{Variable.<VariableName>}}
```

## 🗺️ Planned Features

- [ ] Add contextual autocomplete
- [ ] Connection and query validation against the database
- [ ] A basic SQL designer

---

## 🚧 Limitations

### DataSet Return Type

The `SqlQuery` activity returns results as a DataSet to give developers the option to transpose the results into whatever format they need. 
However, DataSet can **not** be serialized by `System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer` and therefore the activities `Results` attribute is set to `IsSerializable = false`.

If the DataSet needs to be used by another activity it can be stored in a variable of type `object`, provided the Storage type is changed from (the default) `'Workflow Instance'` to `'Memory'`. This prevents Elsa trying to serialize it into the database after execution, which would cause the Workflow to crash. 

There is a future development idea would add a “VariableStorageDriver” feature what would enable you to store the result of a variable externally from the serialized data, but this is not implemented yet.

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

- **`Client not showing in the Studio drop down`**  
  Ensure the Sql client provider is registered in `Program.cs` using `elsa.UseSql(options => ... )`.
